### Fixed
- Fixed an issue where certain features failed to load correctly due to compatibility problems with the newer version.
- Fixed potion brewing behavior so that only the intended base potions can be used in recipes, preventing unintended conversions (e.g., Golden Head no longer allows brewing super god potions from other god potions).
